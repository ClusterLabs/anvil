.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-?, \-h, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this man page.
.TP
\fB\-\-log-secure\fR
When logging, record sensitive data, like passwords.
.TP
\-v, \-vv, \-vvv

.SS "Commands:"
.TP
\fB\-\-anvil\fR <name or UUID>
.TP
This restricts the data to be collected to the Striker dashboards and the specific Anvil! node pair.
.TP
\fB\-\-hosts\fR <comma-separated list of host names or UUIDs>
.TP
This can be used to specify which specific hosts data is collected from. Note that this can be used in conjuction with \fB\-\-anvil\fR to add additional hosts to collect data from, like DR hosts. 
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-file\fR </path/to/file.tar.bz2>
.TP
This allows you to specify the output compressed tarball that the files will be saved in. By default, the output file is \fB/root/anvil-debug_<timestamp>.tar.bz2\fR. If this is a directory (ending in \fB/\fR), the normal file name is created, just in a different directory. If the path ends in a file that doesn't have the \fB.tar.bz2\fR suffix, that suffix will be added automatically. The output file will always be a bzip2's tarball.
