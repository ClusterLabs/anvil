.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anvil-check-memory 
\fI\,<command> \/\fR[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This reports the total memory used by all processes with the passed-in program name. It can be an Anvil! or Striker program, or any other program running on the system.
.TP
This looks in 'ps' and finds pids for the given program name, then parses the '/proc/<pid>/smaps' kernel file to calculate the memory use. This will include shared memory space! Ending the program won't necessarily release the reported amount of RAM.
.TP
The output will be in the format: '<program_name> = <number_of_bytes> # <size in human readable format>
