.SS "Commands:"
\fB\-\-add\fR
This tells the program to add the host as a peer.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\fR
This returns the current list of configured hosts and their host UUIDs.
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\fR
This tells the program to remove the host, preventing it from being a peer.
.TP
\fB\-\-host\fR
This is the hostname or IP address of the host being added. Specifically, it is used to populate the 'database::<host_uuid>::host = <host>' variable.
.TP
\fB\-\-host\-uuid\fR
This is the host UUID of the peer being worked on. 
.TP
\fB\-\-job\-uuid\fR <uuid>
This is the job UUID used to run this job.
.TP
\fB\-\-port\fR
This is the TCP port used to connect to the peer's PostgreSQL database. The default is '5432' and generally should not be changed.
.TP
\fB\-\-password\-file\fR
This is the path to the file that contains the password used to connect to the peer (both the ssh password and the PostgreSQL database). 
.TP
\fB\-\-ping\fR
If set, before a connection to the peer is attempted, a simple ping will be performed. This is recommended as a failed connection to postgresql can take longer, and slow down application when the peer is offline.
