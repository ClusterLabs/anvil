striker-scan-network \- This scans accessible networks to create a map of MAC addresses to IP addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B striker-scan-network 
\fI\,<command> \/\fR[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This does a simple nmap ping sweep of the accessible networks (usually the BCN and IFN). The goal is to create a reference table of MAC addresses to IP addresses, useful for determining which IPs are in use by servers. It also allows a referencing of the MAC addresses to vendors using the OUI data.

\fB\-\-force\fR
This forces a scan, even if it's not been 24 hours since the last time a scan completed.
