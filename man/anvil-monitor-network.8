.SH NAME
anvil-monitor-network \- Tool that watches for changes to any network interface on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anvil-monitor-network 
\fI\,<command> \/\fR[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is meant to be run as a daemon. It will collect data on all interfaces on the host, and then start watching for any changes to those interfaces. Each time a change in state is detected (like a cable being unplugged or plugged in), 'scan-network' will be called. This will keep the Anvil! database up to date with the changes in the network, required for tasks like mapping the network interfaces of new hosts.
