.SS "Commands:"
\fB\-\-task\fR
This is the task being requested. Current options are:
.IP refresh-drbd-resource
This requires \fB\-\-resource <new name>\fR, and will call 'drbdadm adjust <resource>' as a background task and then return immediately. This is required when adding a new volume to an existing resource as 'drbdadm adjust <res>' will hold until it is called on all active DRBD nodes. This blocks the caller after the first remote host call.
