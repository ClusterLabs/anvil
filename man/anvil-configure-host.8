\fB\-\-job\-uuid\fR <name>
The program is normally run as a job, with data on how to configure the host defined in the job. This switch allows the running of a specific job. If this is not set, the program will search for a job that has not yet been picked up by another process. If found, that job UUID is used automatically.
