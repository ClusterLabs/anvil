.TP
This disables the check for LVM physical volumes on the host that can be grown.
.TP
\fB\-\-rejoin\fR
.TP
If this is set, the host will be (re)joined to an existing Anvil! node. This is used to bring this host into an Anvil! subnode, typically after a subnode failure / rebuild.
.TP
\fB\-\-yes\fR
.TP
This confirms without prompt that you want to rejoin the detected Anvil! node.
