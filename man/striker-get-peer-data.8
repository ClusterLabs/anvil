.SS "Commands:"
.TP
\fB\-\-password\fR <password>
If the '\fB\-\-state\-uuid\fR' is not used, the alternative way to pass the password to use to connect to the \fB\-\-target\fR is using this switch. Be mindful of escaping or quoting the password as necessary.
.TP
\fB\-\-state\-uuid\fR <uuid>
If the password is stored in the database's 'states' table, this is the 'state_uuid' that points to the record with the password stored in the 'state_note'. Once this is read, the 'state_uuid' column is deleted, so it's one-use.
.TP
\fB\-\-target\fR [user@]<ip_or_hostname>[:port]
This is the target you want to collect data from.
