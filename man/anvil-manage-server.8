.TP
\fB\-\-server\fR all, or <name or uuid>
This is the server to work on.
.TP
\fB\-\-resync\fR
This will check to see if the server is sync'ing on this host. If it is not, and if there are sufficient free resources, the server will be configured locally. This will create a local logical volume, which will be used to connect to the peer's replicated storage. The definition file will be written out, if needed. If '\fB\-\-server\fR' isn't used, all servers will be sync'ed (alphatically, stopping if there are insufficient resources).
