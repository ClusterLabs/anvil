The definition for the server: [#!variable!server!#] was changed via Striker. 
- Pushing the new version to the on-disk definition file [#!variable!definition_file!#]
- Also updating definition used by the hypervisor.

- Note: You may need to reboot or power cycle for the changes to take effect.

- The changes are:

#!variable!disk_difference!#
==[ Hypervisor ]======
#!variable!virsh_difference!#
==[ New Definition ]==
#!variable!new_difference!#
======================
