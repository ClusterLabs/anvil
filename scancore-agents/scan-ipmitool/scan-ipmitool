# ScanCore Scan Agent for 'ipmitool' to query IPMI data.
#
# https://alteeve.com
# 
# Exit Codes:
# 0   - Success
# 1   - Passed in host name was not found in the database.
# 2   - Bad number of scan_ipmitool_value_uuid's returned for the given 
# 
# 255 - The host's UUID isn't in the hosts table yet, ScanCore itself hasn't been run.
# 
# TODO:
# - Set a health score for over/under-temp events.
# - Don't bother scanning other hosts.... ScanCore does direct calls to decide if/when to reboot an offline 
#   node.
# - Decide if we should parse 'ipmitool sel list'
# - Detect a hung BMC by trying to talk to ourselves and, if that fails, send 'ipmitool bmc reset cold'. 
#   Possibly try pinging the IPMI from the peer as it is not always possible to ping our own interface when
#   the IPMI and eth device share the same physical connector.
# - Update the string processing from the '!!x!name=a,value=b,units=c!!' method to the new method here:
#   https://alteeve.com/w/ScanCore#Unit_Parsing
# - Change 'scan_ipmitool_value_uuid' to 'scan_ipmitool_value_uuid'.
# - Monitor / Alert on RPM, wattage, voltage, etc 
#
# - A PSU wattage dropping to '0 Watts', in conjunction with it's fan dropping to '0' RPMs, is the sign that 
#   input power was lost and should set a health score of ~5.
# 
# NOTE: 
# - Health values
#   - IPMI BMC    - Hung       = 10
#   - Temperature - Critical   = 2
#   - Temperature - Warning    = 1
#   - Fan         - Failed     = 5
#   - PSU         - Lost Input = 5

A Hung/crashed BMC will fail to reset with this:
====
[root@nr-c03n01 ~]# time ipmitool bmc reset cold
Get Device ID command failed: 0xff Unspecified error
Sent cold reset command to MC

real	3m52.860s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.002s
====

Seeing this, we need to ask the peer to power-cycle us (/shared/status/.node.helpme -> 'task = power_cycle')
and set the health to 'warning'. We will call anvil-safe-stop.

The peer, on seeing (/shared/status/.node.helpme -> 'task = power_cycle'), will start pinging the peer on the
BCN and SN. Once there is no response, we will start a 60 second counter, then cut power to the PDUs for 60
seconds, then restore power. We will then start pinging the IPMI interface. Once it responds, we will wait 60
seconds and then try to power it back on.
