Note: Node peers should always use protocol C and fencing set to 'resource-and-stonith'. DR Host peers can use either protocol A or C, and fencing should always be set to 'dont-care'.

Protocol A is suitable for DR hosts with higher latency connections, but the DR host will be allowed to fall slightly behind the nodes. Protocol C ensures that the DR host is never behind, but could hurt storage performance.

Note: Protocol A is OK when replicating to a DR host. When used, it allows the DR host to fall behind the nodes, which helps avoids a performance hit when the network latency / speed to the DR host is higher than tolerable. Between nodes, protocol C must always be used, which ensures synchronous replication.
