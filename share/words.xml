# To help understand how the Anvil! is used, some features will "call home" to record anonymous information
# about a machine participating in an Anvil! system. An example is DRBD's 'usage-count' option. If you wish 
# to not have this happen, set this to '1'.
sys::privacy::strong						=	#!data!sys::privacy::strong!#

### Features
# Normally, if one node in the Anvil! is healthier than the other, it will pull the servers from the peer
# on to it. This is a process called "preventative live migration". If you would like to disable this 
# feature, set this to '1'.
#feature::scancore::disable::preventative-live-migration	=	0

# If "preventative live migration" is enabled, this sets the threshold to trigger migration. The difference
# in health score has to be equal to or greater than the number below. The health scores are usually set to
# '1' per event, though scan agents are free to assign higher scores per event. The default threshold is 
# '2'. To migrate on any health difference, set this to '1'. Use whole numbers only. 
#feature::scancore::threshold::preventative-live-migration	=	2

### Database
# Database connections;
# 
# Each Anvil! database is defined below using an incrementing counter as the second variable. The value of 
# the second variable is the local 'host_uuid' (via: dmidecode --string system-uuid | perl -ne 'print lc').
# This ensures that entries can be moved and copied without causing conflicts.
# 
# There are six variables for each database definition;
# host     = This is the (resolvable) host name or IP address of the peer database.
# port     = This is the TCP port used to connect to the database. By default, it is 5432
# password = This is the password used to connect to the database.
#            NOTE: Do not directly change the database password. Please use 'anvil-update-password' so that
#                  the WebUI, database, nodes and peers are all kept in sync.
# ping     = If set, this will cause a ping to be made against the database server before the actual 
#            connection is attempted. This can be useful when peer dashboards are offline for extended 
#            periods of time. The value can be any real number and will be used as the timeout for the actual
#            ping. If the peer dashboard is on the same subnet, a value of '0.25' (250ms) should be a good 
#            balance between giving the peer a chance to reply and not waiting too long when it is offline. 
#            If the peer is remote, you will want to set this to '1' (1000ms) or higher. 
#            
#            Setting this to '0' disables pinging before connecting entirely. In this case, if the peer is
#            offline, it will take about 3 seconds on average for the connection attempt to timeout. This 
#            might be necessary if the peer dashboard is behind a firewall/router or otherwise can't respond
#            to ICMP pings.
# NOTE: The database is called 'anvil' and the database owner is 'admin'.

### end db list ###

# To keep Anvil!'s database growth in check, an auto-archive mechanism is used by some agents where, at the 
# end of each scan, the number of records in the history schema for a given table are counted (restricted to 
# the agent's host, when appropriate). 
# 
# When the number exceeds the trigger, the number of records that are archived is approximately (number of 
# records above trigger + 'count'). This is not an exact number because a representative timestamp will be 
# selected from the history schema at this count, and then any record equal to or older than the time stamp 
# is removed.
# 
# To protect against the potential of using too much disk space, archives are off by default. Under normal 
# behaviour, old records are simply removed. To enable the archive function, set this to '1'.
#sys::database::archive::save_to_disk				=	1
# 
# When archiving to disk is enabled, to protect against large memory use or long archive times in the case 
# where the number of records to archive are particularly large, the 'division' value is used to break up the
# archive job into "chunks". Generally speaking, the division should be greater than the count, and never be 
# needed. However, if the archive process takes too long, or if the archive was triggered well above the 
# trigger value, the division can help prevent using too much memory at once. If division is set to '0', 
# archive jobs will never be divided.
# 
# The archives are all stored in the specified directory using the name format 
# '<agent>.<table>.<timestamp>.bz2' and the archives are synced between dashboards for safe keeping. Archive 
# files are never removed automatically.
# 
# To disable auto-archiving entirely, set 'trigger' to '0'.
# 
# NOTE: If the archive directory doesn't exist, Anvil! will create it 
#       automatically the first time it is needed.

### Apache stuff
# By default, we try to determine the host type which anvil RPM is installed. If, for some reason, you want

# NOTE: Be sure the language exists before changing it!

# By default, if a configured database is not accessible, a log level 1 alert is registered. This can cause a
# lot of log traffic. If you want to silence these log alerts, you can set the value below to be higher than
# your current active log level (default is '1', so set to '2' or '3' to silence).
# NOTE: It's important to only use this temporarily. 
sys::database::failed_connection_log_level			=	1

# This controls what log facility to use by default.
# NOTE: This will always be 'authpriv' when a log entry is marked as secure.

### Install Target options - (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
# Note; Please see 'pxe.txt' for editable templates for 'dhcpd.conf', (tftpboot's BIOS) 'default' and the
#       kickstart templates.
# 
# This section allows for adapting certain installations of systems via the Install Target feature. 
# Generally, these don't need to be edited.
# 
# This controls the keyboard configuration. See: 
# - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f28/install-guide/appendixes/Kickstart_Syntax_Reference/#sect-kickstart-commands-keyboard
#kickstart::keyboard						=	--vckeymap=us --xlayouts='us'

# This sets the default password of newly stage-1 built machines. Generally, this shouldn't be changed. It is
# recorded in plain text and it is used in the stage-2 configuration tools. 
#kickstart::password						=	Initial1
#
# This is the system timezone to be set. Generally, it's recommended to leave the Anvil! machines to UTC, but
# you might want to change this if you spend time working directly on the various Anvil! cluster machines.
#kickstart::timezone						=	Etc/GMT --isUtc

# If this is set to '1', the packages used to build machines via the Install Target feature will not 
# auto-update.
install-manifest::refresh-packages				=	1

# This controls how often the local RPM repository is checked for updates. The default is '86400' seconds 
# (one day). If anything, you might want to increase this. Common values;
# 86400   = Once per day
# 604800  = Once per week
# 2419200 = Once per month (well, 4 weeks)
install-manifest::refresh-period				=	86400


### This controls Striker-specific features
# This can be set a a comma-separated list of packages to be added to Striker's RPM repos. Note that this is
# only useful is you want to store EL8-specific packages needed outside the Anvil!.
striker::repo::extra-packages					=	

### System functions
# The machines used in the Anvil! are treated as appliances, and thus fully under our control. As such, much 
# of the system is monitored, managed and auto-repaired. This can frustrate sysadmins. As such, an admin may
# use the 'system::*' options to retake control over some system behaviour.

# Setting this to '0' will disable auto-management of the firewall.
sys::manage::firewall						=	1


### Server related options
