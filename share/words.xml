# To help understand how the Anvil! is used, some features will "call home" to record anonymous information
# about a machine participating in an Anvil! system. An example is DRBD's 'usage-count' option. If you wish 
# to not have this happen, set this to '1'.
sys::privacy::strong						=	#!data!sys::privacy::strong!#

### Features
# Normally, if one node in the Anvil! is healthier than the other, it will pull the servers from the peer
# on to it. This is a process called "preventative live migration". If you would like to disable this 
# feature, set this to '1'.
feature::scancore::disable::preventative-live-migration		=	0

### Database
# Database connections;
# 
# Each Anvil! database is defined below using an incrementing counter as the second variable. The value of 
# the second variable is the local 'host_uuid' (via: dmidecode --string system-uuid | perl -ne 'print lc').
# This ensures that entries can be moved and copied without causing conflicts.
# 
# There are six variables for each database definition;
# host     = This is the (resolvable) host name or IP address of the peer database.
# port     = This is the TCP port used to connect to the database. By default, it is 5432
# password = This is the password used to connect to the database.
#            NOTE: Do not directly change the database password. Please use 'anvil-update-password' so that
#                  the WebUI, database, nodes and peers are all kept in sync.
# ping     = If set, this will cause a ping to be made against the database server before the actual 
#            connection is attempted. This can be useful when peer dashboards are offline for extended 
#            periods of time. The value can be any real number and will be used as the timeout for the actual
#            ping. If the peer dashboard is on the same subnet, a value of '0.25' (250ms) should be a good 
#            balance between giving the peer a chance to reply and not waiting too long when it is offline. 
#            If the peer is remote, you will want to set this to '1' (1000ms) or higher. 
#            
#            Setting this to '0' disables pinging before connecting entirely. In this case, if the peer is
#            offline, it will take about 3 seconds on average for the connection attempt to timeout. This 
#            might be necessary if the peer dashboard is behind a firewall/router or otherwise can't respond
#            to ICMP pings.
# NOTE: The database is called 'anvil' and the database owner is 'admin'.

# To keep Anvil!'s database growth in check, an auto-archive mechanism is used by some agents where, at the 
# end of each scan, the number of records in the history schema for a given table are counted (restricted to 
# the agent's host, when appropriate). 
# 
# When the number exceeds the trigger, the number of records that are archived is approximately (number of 
# records above trigger + 'count'). This is not an exact number because a representative timestamp will be 
# selected from the hostory schema at this count, and then any record equal to or older than the time stamp 
# is removed.
# 
# To protect against the potential of using too much disk space, archives are off by default. Under normal 
# behaviour, old records are simple removed. To enable the archive function, set this to '1'.
#sys::database::archive::save_to_disk				=	1
# 
# When archiving to disk is enabled, to protect against large memory use or long archive times in the case 
# where the number of records to archive are particularly large, the 'division' value is used to break up the
# archive job into "chunks". Generally speaking, the division should be greater than the count, and never be 
# needed. However, if the archive process takes too long, or if the archive was triggered well above the 
# trigger value, the division can help prevent using too much memory at once. If division is set to '0', 
# archive jobs will never be divided.
# 
# The archives are all stored in the specified directory using the name format 
# '<agent>.<table>.<timestamp>.bz2' and the archives are synced between dashboards for safe keeping. Archive 
# files are never removed automatically.
# 
# To disable auto-archiving entirely, set 'trigger' to '0'.
# 
# NOTE: If the archive directory doesn't exist, Anvil! will create it 
#       automatically the first time it is needed.

# NOTE: It's important to only use this temporarily. 
sys::database::failed_connection_log_level			=	1

# 
# This section allows for adapting certain installations of systems via the Install Target feature. 
# Generally, these don't need to be edited.

# If this is set to '1', the packages used to build machines via the Install Target feature will not 
# auto-update.

# 604800  = Once per week
# 2419200 = Once per month (well, 4 weeks)

### This controls Striker-specific features

### System functions
