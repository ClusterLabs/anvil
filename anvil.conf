# This puts a limit on how many queries (writes, generally) to make in a single batch transaction. This is 
# useful when doing very large transacions, like resync'ing a large table, by limiting how long a given 
# transaction can take and how much memory is used. 
#sys::database::maximum_batch_size	=	25000

# By default, we try to determine the host type using the host name. The rules used for this can be seen in 
# 'perldoc Anvil::Tools::System -> determine_host_type'. If you are using non-standard host names, or for some
# other reason want to statically assign the host type, you can do so with this variable. Note that this sets
# the host type of this host only. You will need to set this appropriately on other hosts.
# 
# Normally, you should not need to set this.

# This configuration file provides a way to override Anvil::Tools' built-in defaults.

# This controls the default language. The value is the ISO code of the country's language you want to use by
# default. Note that the logging language is set with 'defaults::log::language' below.
# NOTE: Be sure the language exists before changing it!
#defaults::languages::output				=	en_CA

# This controls how many loops Anvil::Tools::Words is allow to make while processing a string. This acts as a 
# mechanism to exit infinite loops, and generally should not need to be changed.

### Logging options
# This controls whether all database transactions are recorded or not. Genreally this should be left off 
# unless you are debugging the program.
# WARNING: This ignores 'secure', and will always be logged. Be careful about exposing sensitive data!
#sys::database::log_transactions			=	1

# This controls what log facility to use by default.
# NOTE: This will always be 'authpriv' when a log entry is marked as secure.
#defaults::log::facility				=	local0

# This controls what language logs are recorded in. Be sure that the language exists before changing it!
#defaults::log::language				=	en_CA

# This controls the default log level. See 'perldoc Anvil::Tools::Logs' for details.
#defaults::log::level					=	1

# This controls whether sensitive log entries are logged or not. Generally, this should be left disabled!
#defaults::log::secure					=	0,

# THis sets the default log server to send the log entries to. Leave it blank in most cases.

# This sets the default log tag used when logging an entry. Most programs will likely override this.

### Templates
# This sets the default template used when rendering HTML pages. It must be the same as the directory name
# under /var/www/html/skins/

### Database

# To keep ScanCore's database growth in check, an auto-archive mechanism is 
# used by some agents where, at the end of each scan, the number of records in
# the history schema for a given table are counted (restricted to the agent's 
# host, when appropriate). 
# 
# When the number exceeds the trigger, the number of records that are archived
# is approximately (number of records above trigger + 'count'). This is not an
# exact number because a representative timestamp will be selected from the
# hostory schema at this count, and then any record equal to or older than the
# time stamp is removed.
# 
# To protect against the potential of using too much disk space, archives are
# off by default. Under normal behaviour, old records are simple removed. To
# enable the archive function, set this to '1'.
#scancore::archive::save_to_disk	=	1
# 
# When archiving to disk is enabled, to protect against large memory use or 
# long archive times in the case where the number of records to archive are 
# particularly large, the 'division' value is used to break up the archive job
# into "chunks". Generally speaking, the division should be greater than the 
# count, and never be needed. However, if the archive process takes too long, 
# or if the archive was triggered well above the trigger value, the division 
# can help prevent using too much memory at once. If division is set to '0', 
# archive jobs will never be divided.
# 
# The archives are all stored in the specified 
# directory using the name format '<agent>.<table>.<timestamp>.bz2' and the
# archives are synced between dashboards for safe keeping. Archive files are 
# never removed automatically.
# 
# To disable auto-archiving entirely, set 'trigger' to '0'.
# 
# NOTE: If the archive directory doesn't exist, ScanCore will create it 
#       automatically the first time it is needed.
