	# ### This is the main Anvil! configuration file.

# To help understand how the Anvil! is used, some features will "call home" to record anonymous information
# about a machine participating in an Anvil! system. An example is DRBD's 'usage-count' option. If you wish 
# to not have this happen, set this to '1'.
sys::privacy::strong						=	0

### Features
# Normally, if one node in the Anvil! is healthier than the other, it will pull the servers from the peer
# on to it. This is a process called "preventative live migration". If you would like to disable this 
# feature, set this to '1'.
feature::scancore::disable::preventative-live-migration		=	0

# This can be used to disable anvil management of SMTP servers. This should rarely be needed, but allows 
# an admin to stop the Anvil! from modifying postfix if you require a setup the software does not handle
# properly.
#feature::manage-smtp::disable					=	1

# If a node is found to be powered off, and there is no reason recorded in the database, it will be booted.
# The assumption is that an accidental power off occurred. If you would like to have nodes that power off
# stay off until manually started, set this to '0'
#feature::scancore::disable::boot-unknown-stop			=	1

### Database
# Database connections;
# 
# Each Anvil! database is defined below using an incrementing counter as the second variable. The value of 
# the second variable is the local 'host_uuid' (via: dmidecode --string system-uuid | perl -ne 'print lc').
# This ensures that entries can be moved and copied without causing conflicts.
# 
# There are six variables for each database definition;
# host     = This is the (resolvable) host name or IP address of the peer database.
# port     = This is the TCP port used to connect to the database. By default, it is 5432
# password = This is the password used to connect to the database.
#            NOTE: Do not directly change the database password. Please use 'anvil-update-password' so that
#                  the WebUI, database, nodes and peers are all kept in sync.
# ping     = If set, this will cause a ping to be made against the database server before the actual 
#            connection is attempted. This can be useful when peer dashboards are offline for extended 
#            periods of time. The value can be any real number and will be used as the timeout for the actual
#            ping. If the peer dashboard is on the same subnet, a value of '0.25' (250ms) should be a good 
#            balance between giving the peer a chance to reply and not waiting too long when it is offline. 
#            If the peer is remote, you will want to set this to '1' (1000ms) or higher. 
#            
#            Setting this to '0' disables pinging before connecting entirely. In this case, if the peer is
#            offline, it will take about 3 seconds on average for the connection attempt to timeout. This 
#            might be necessary if the peer dashboard is behind a firewall/router or otherwise can't respond
#            to ICMP pings.
# NOTE: The database is called 'anvil' and the database owner is 'admin'.

# To keep Anvil!'s database growth in check, an auto-archive mechanism is used by some agents where, at the 
# end of each scan, the number of records in the history schema for a given table are counted (restricted to 
# the agent's host, when appropriate). 
# 
# When the number exceeds the trigger, the number of records that are archived is approximately (number of 
# records above trigger + 'count'). This is not an exact number because a representative timestamp will be 
# selected from the hostory schema at this count, and then any record equal to or older than the time stamp 
# is removed.
# 
# To protect against the potential of using too much disk space, archives are off by default. Under normal 
# behaviour, old records are simple removed. To enable the archive function, set this to '1'.
#sys::database::archive::save_to_disk				=	1
# 
# When archiving to disk is enabled, to protect against large memory use or long archive times in the case 
# where the number of records to archive are particularly large, the 'division' value is used to break up the
# archive job into "chunks". Generally speaking, the division should be greater than the count, and never be 
# needed. However, if the archive process takes too long, or if the archive was triggered well above the 
# trigger value, the division can help prevent using too much memory at once. If division is set to '0', 
# archive jobs will never be divided.
# 
# The archives are all stored in the specified directory using the name format 
# '<agent>.<table>.<timestamp>.bz2' and the archives are synced between dashboards for safe keeping. Archive 
# files are never removed automatically.
# 
# To disable auto-archiving entirely, set 'trigger' to '0'.
# 
# NOTE: If the archive directory doesn't exist, Anvil! will create it 
#       automatically the first time it is needed.

### Logging options
# This controls whether all database transactions are recorded or not. Genreally this should be left off

# NOTE: It's important to only use this temporarily.

### Install Target options
# 
# Note; The Install Target function is not yet available.
# 
# This section allows for adapting certain installations of systems via the Install Target feature. 
# Generally, these don't need to be edited.
# 
# This controls the keyboard configuration. See: 
# - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f28/install-guide/appendixes/Kickstart_Syntax_Reference/#sect-kickstart-commands-keyboard
#kickstart::keyboard						=	--vckeymap=us --xlayouts='us'

# If this is set to '1', the packages used to build machines via the Install Target feature will not 
# auto-update.

# 604800  = Once per week
# 2419200 = Once per month (well, 4 weeks)

### System functions
# The machines used in the Anvil! are treated as appliances, and thus fully under our control. As such, much 
# of the system is monitored, managed and auto-repaired. This can frustrate sysadmins. As such, an admin may
# use the 'system::*' options to retake control over some system behaviour.

# Setting this to '0' will disable auto-management of the firewall.
#sys::manage::firewall						=	1

# By default, 'IFN1' is set as the default zone. If you'd like to override this, set it here. This must match
# one of the zones shown in 'firewall-cmd --get-active-zones'. If the value here doesn't match, it will be 
# ignored.
#sys::firewall::default-zone					=	IFN1

# By default, the Anvil! will detect and configure the IPMI BMC (iDRAC, iLO, RSA, etc). To disable this, set
# this to '0'. Note that if you do this, you will need to ensure that IPMI-based fencing is configured 
# properly!
#sys::manage::ipmi						=	0

# By default, Anvil! nodes reserve 8 GiB of RAM for host OS use. That is to say, if a node (pair) has 128GiB
# of physical RAM, 120 GiB will be available for allocation to servers. Generally, this should NOT be reduced
# as doing so could trigger oom-killer (out of memory killer) to terminate servers. This is an integer 
# representing the reserved RAM in MiB
# NOTE: Minimum is 1024, but really, never go below 4096 unless you _really_ know what you're doing.
#anvil_resources::ram::reserved					=	8192

# If you wish to alter the amount of reservered RAM for a single Anvil! node, you can use:
#anvil::<anvil_uuid>::resources::ram::reserved			=	8192

# When Zabbix is installed, the Zabbix server defaults to use port 80, which conflicts with Striker's use of
# port 80. As such, anvil-daemon checks to see if Zabbix is installed and, of so, updates it's apache config
# to use port 8080. If you want to use a different port (other than 80), you can do so below
#sys::port::zabbix						=	8080

### Server related options
# This is the "short list" of servers shown when provisioning a new server. To see the full list of options,

# behavious by setting this to '0'. Be aware of course that you will need to manually update or add entries
# going forward.
#sys::hosts::manage						=	0

# By default, the Anvil! will try to auto-add Strikers found in the database that are not yet in this 
# anvil.conf config file. This is meant to automate the rebuild of strikers. If you want to prevent this
# behaviour, set this to '0'.
#sys::striker::auto-add						=	1

# During the startup of a machine, Network Manager can take a minute or two before the network is stable. By
# default, anvil-daemon and scancore will pause during startup, waiting for the network to stabilize. By

# This value will be updated by anvil-configure-host when the initial configuration completes.
network::wait_for_network::timeout				=	300

# If you want to specify one or more NTP servers, you can specify them here. To specify multiple servers,
